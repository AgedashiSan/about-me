    About Me
  </h1>
  <p>
    Hi I'm Zach Chen. I'm currently a Bay Area based Interaction Designer cruising in the realm of aesthetic experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has become a world of emergent design with endless possibilities. Solving problems is easy, finding them is hard. Ideas are cheap, execution is gold. I'm ready to get my hands dirty. Let's design and build stuff.
